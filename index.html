            <p>Hey there my name is Mikel pronounced the same way as Michael, or Mike works too.
                here are some things about me. </p>
            <p>
                Currently I'm running the Cyber Grizzlies Esports Club here at Georgian
                (shameless plug)
                go check it out here: <a href="https://www.cybergrizzlies.ca/" target="_blank">link</a>.
                My goal as president is to create a long-lasting space here for Esports at Georgian for students.

            <p>
                Another passion project I'm working on is a team management platform for the club called Player
                Base. It allows fans and players to stay up to date with what teams are up to.
